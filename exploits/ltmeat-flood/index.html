          <ol>
            <li>Add a new folder to your bookmarks bar.</li>
            <li>In the folder, add the extension settings URL of the extension you want to freeze <b>chrome://extensions/?id=extensionid</b>.</li>
            <li>Paste the background or manifest page of the extension into the folder <b>chrome-extension://extensionid/_generated_background_page.html</b> 800+ times. It must be enough to make browser loading very slow but not crash.</li>
            <li>Open the folder in a new window. That option is in the folder's context menu.</li>
            <li>Close the new window when its tabs begin to load.</li>
            <li>Open the folder in a new window again. The pages will be hanged by Chrome as if the tabs were duplicated from hanged ones.</li>
            <li>Flip the <b>Allow access to file URLs</b> switch in the extension settings.</li>
            <li><b>The window can be closed afterward. If the extension reloads automatically and does not freeze, open a larger set of tabs from the folder. This does not usually work on any extension supported by LTMEAT's Alternate Method #1. Extensions vary on how they are built.</b></li>
