          <ol>
            <li>Find a page belonging to the extension you want to disable. You'll need your extension's 32-character ID to continue. If you're trying to bypass stuff, try finding it in a filter extension ID list. For further help, check the help section. Once you have the ID, you'll be guaranteed to get to a working <b>chrome-extension://</b> page by visiting the manifest file: (with your extension's ID substituted in, of course). Example: <b>chrome-extension://jdogphakondfdmcanpapfahkdomaicfa/manifest.json</b></b></li>
            <li>Bookmark the extension page (bookmark A) if you wish. Then, bookmark <b>chrome://kill</b> (B) and <b>chrome://hang</b> (C).</li>
            <li>While on the extension page (A), click the <b>chrome://kill bookmark</b> (B). The page should crash. You should already have the next step prepared.</li>
            <li>Instantly start spamming <b>chrome://hang</b> (bookmark C) and quickly reload the page while spamming using the refresh key on your keyboard (or less ideally, Ctrl+R). You should have reloaded within one or two seconds of killing the page.</li>
            <li><b>Extra: If you are unable to visit the extension page (bookmark A) after trying the exploit, then LTMEAT worked! Please read the help section if you had an issue (for example, if no sites seem to load). You can restore extensions by signing out and back into your Chromebook.</b></li>
